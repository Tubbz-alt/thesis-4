% Intro + kbp schema
A common use case for open IE systems is to map them to a
  known relation schema.
This can either be done manually with minimal annotation effort, or
  automatically from available training data.
We use both methods in our TAC-KBP evaluation.
A collection of relation mappings was constructed by a single
  annotator in approximately a day,\footnote{
    The official submission we compare against claimed two weeks for constructing
    their manual mapping, although a version of their system constructed in only
    3 hours performs nearly as well.
  } and a relation mapping was learned
  using the procedure described in this section.
%We use the KBP relation schema, taken from
%  the TAC-KBP challenges.
%This consists of 42 relations (41 after the 2012 evaluation).
%%  aligning to Wikipedia Infoboxes for people and organizations.
%  Examples include \rel{Per:Title}, a person's title in an
%  organization (President, CEO, etc.); \rel{Per:City\_Of\_Birth}, the
%  city a person was born in; or \rel{Org:Founded}, the date an organization
%  was founded.

%% Why OpenIE?
%%The natural approach for relation extraction when the relation
%%  schema is known \textit{a priori} is to train either 
%%  a supervised or distantly supervised extractor
%%  directly on the relation set.
%There are a number of motivations for using open domain
%  relation triples for this task.
%% Domain adaptation
%The most salient of these is that an open IE system can be adapted
%  easily to new relation schemata.
%In part, this is useful if the new schema does not have any training data
%  to train a supervised (or distantly supervised) classifier on; a relatively
%  small and intuitive annotation effort can translate between open IE relations
%  and many relations in many schemata.
%But, even when training data is available, learning a mapping from open IE
%  relations to the given schema is often faster and higher precision than
%  training a supervised classifier.

% Treat KBP relations as random variables
We map open IE relations to the KBP schema by searching for co-occurring
  relations in a large distantly-labeled corpus, and marking open IE and
  KBP relation pairs which have a high PMI$^2$ value
  \cite{key:1994dailee-pmisquared,key:2005evert-pmi}
  conditioned on their
  type signatures matching.
To compute PMI$^2$, we collect probabilities for the open IE and KBP
  relation co-occurring, the probability of the open IE relation occurring,
  and the probability of the KBP relation occurring.
Each of these probabilities is conditioned on the type signature of the relation.
For example, the joint probability of KBP relation $r_k$ and open IE relation
  $r_o$, given a type signature of $t_1, t_2$, would be

\vspace{0.25cm}
\begin{equation*}
  p(r_k, r_o \mid t_1, t_2) = \frac{
    \textrm{count}(r_k, r_o,  t_1, t_2)
  }{
    \sum_{r_k', r_o'}\textrm{count}(r_k', r_o', t_1, t_2)
  }.
\end{equation*}
\vspace{0.25cm}

% PMI^2
Omitting the conditioning on the type signature for notational convenience,
  and defining $p(r_k)$ and $p(r_o)$ analogously,
  we can then compute The PMI$^2$ value between the two relations:

\vspace{0.25cm}
\begin{equation*}
  \textrm{PMI}^2(r_k, r_o) = \log \left( \frac{p(r_k, r_o)^2}{p(r_k) \cdot p(r_o)} \right)
\end{equation*}
\vspace{0.25cm}

Note that in addition to being a measure related to PMI, this captures
  a notion similar to \textit{alignment by agreement} 
  \cite{key:2006liang-alignment};
  the formula can be equivalently written as 
  $\log \left[ p(r_k \mid r_o) p(r_o \mid r_k)\right]$.
It is also functionally the same as the JC WordNet distance measure
  \cite{key:1997jc-similarity}.

% Tweaks made in practice
Some sample type checked relation mappings are given in \reftab{samplemapping}.
In addition to intuitive mappings (e.g., \ww{found in} $\rightarrow$ 
  \rel{Org:Founded}), we can note some rare, but high precision pairs
  (e.g., \ww{invest fund of} $\rightarrow$ \rel{Org:Founded\_By}).
We can also see the noise in distant supervision occasionally permeate 
  the mapping, e.g., with \ww{elect president of} $\rightarrow$ \rel{Per:LOC\_Of\_Death}
  -- a president is likely to die in his own country.


%For the purposes of creating this mapping, relations involving
%  locations (e.g., city of birth and country of birth) have been collapsed,
%  along with their NER types, as these can be fully disambiguated by their
%  context in the sentence.
%If a relation mapped to (\textit{location}) of birth is found in a sentence
%  with a city as its object, then we can unambiguously map this to the relation
%  \rel{Per:City\_Of\_Birth}.
  
%% Compare to Soderland NFL
%Prior work on learning mappings from open IE to a relation schema for NFL
%  games \cite{key:2010soderland-nfl} showed only modest improvements, even
%  when incorporating active learning.
%For their task, they used a metric tuned to precision on the training data:
%  the fraction of correct versus incorrect extractions each relation produces.
%We propose that either the automated mapping of the sort we propose inherently
%  requires a very large corpus to gather accurate statistics, or that the
%  choice of PMI as a selection method creates a more robust mapping than tuning
%  directly to training precision.


%Given a sufficiently large corpus, we can compute these probabilities
%  empirically as the number of times we see a relation ($r$)
%  in the corpus normalized by the number of times we see any relation with the 
%  same type signature ($t_1, t_2$):
%\begin{equation*}
%  p(r \mid t_1, t_2) = \frac{
%    \textrm{count}(r, t_1, t_2)
%  }{
%    \sum_{r'}\textrm{count}(r', t_1, t_2)
%  }
%\end{equation*}
%
%
%We describe our method for mapping from open IE relations to the KBP relation
%  making use of our distantly supervised corpus (see \refsec{distsup}).
%At a high level, our mapping will be pairs which have a high PMI$^2$ value
%  between the open IE and KBP relation.
%We treat the existence of a relation between two mentions in a sentence as
%  a random variable, conditioned on the NER type signature of the mentions.
%For instance, we can describe the probability of the relation 
%  \rel{Per:Country\_Of\_Birth} occurring between \ww{Barack Obama} and
%  \ww{America} in the sentence
%\begin{center}
%  \ww{Barack Obama was born in America.}
%\end{center}
%as:
%\begin{equation*}
%  p(\rel{Per:Country\_Of\_Birth} \mid \typ{Person}, \typ{Country})
%\end{equation*}
%
%% Treat open IE relations as random variables
%Similarly, for open IE relations, we can describe the probability of
%  \rel{be born in} occurring between \ww{Barack Obama} and \ww{America} as:
%\begin{equation*}
%  p(\rel{be born in} \mid \typ{Person}, \typ{Country})
%\end{equation*}
%
%% Note on RegexNER
%Note that the NER tag set used is enriched somewhat to reflect the types used
%  in the KBP relations more closely. 
%10 additional named entity tags are added to the standard tag set, covering
%  additional location types (city, state, country), religious affiliation,
%  and some special cases (e.g., title, URL).
%These are generated from a fixed gazette, as described in
%  \newcite{key:2014angeli-kbp}.
%
%% Compute probabilities
%Given a sufficiently large corpus, we can compute these probabilities
%  empirically as the number of times we see a relation ($r$)
%  in the corpus normalized by the number of times we see any relation with the 
%  same type signature ($t_1, t_2$):
%\begin{equation*}
%  p(r \mid t_1, t_2) = \frac{
%    \textrm{count}(r, t_1, t_2)
%  }{
%    \sum_{r'}\textrm{count}(r', t_1, t_2)
%  }
%\end{equation*}
%
%% Misc notes
%For the KBP relations, these counts are the counts derived from the distantly
%  supervised dataset.
%With open IE relations, the counts can be computed directly.
%Relations which do not have a well defined type signature (i.e., are not
%  between named entities) are discarded.
%For brevity, going forward we will drop the conditioning on the type signature
%  of the relation and assume it to be implicitly present.
%
%% Joint probability
%The joint probability between a KBP relation $r_k$ and open IE relation
%  $r_o$, $p(r_k, r_o)$, can then be computed analogously as the fraction of
%  times these two relations co-occur out of the total number of times any two
%  relations co-occur (conditioned on the type signature of the arguments):
%\begin{equation*}
%  p(r_k, r_o) = \frac{
%    \textrm{count}(r_k, r_0)
%  }{
%    \sum_{r_k', r_o'}\textrm{count}(r_k', r_o')
%  }
%\end{equation*}
