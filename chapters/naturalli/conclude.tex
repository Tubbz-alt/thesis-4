\Section{naturalli-conclusion}{Conclusion}
In this chapter we have introduced NaturalLI, an inference system over
  unstructured text intended to infer common sense facts.
We have shown that we can run inference over a large set of premises
  while maintaining Natural Logic semantics, and that
  we can learn how to infer unseen common sense facts.
However, the inferences that the system excels at are still limited
  in two key ways: first, the premise set must consist of simple, atomic facts.
Second, if the search fails to find a premise in the knowledge base
  then we still have no signal about the truth of our query.
The subsequent two chapters address these two limitations.
